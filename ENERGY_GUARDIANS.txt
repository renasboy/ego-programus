This one is dedicated to all of us, Guardians of the Universe Energy. 

=============================== ENERGY GUARDIANS ===============================

			We are guardians of the Energy.
	       Energy which belongs to the master of all masters.
		Surfing the Energy, we can play with the Energy.
		Slowly digging it, we can play with the Energy.
			  Schematics of the universe,
		     work based on feelings and intentions.
		     Feelings can be translated to emotions
		      and intentions to purpose, however,
		    feelings and intentions keep on changing
			 as everything in the Universe.
			Therefore nothing is permanent,
			       and will never be.
			 We are real chemical machines
		       and we need chemistry to succeed.
	     All we are doing is to move the Energy in the Universe
			and the Energy stays locked in.
		     All we need is here in this Universe.
