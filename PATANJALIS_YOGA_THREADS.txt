This one is dedicated to all YOGA apprentices, from YOGA SUTRAS OF PATANJALI.

============================ PATANJALI'S YOGA THREADS ==========================

				 CONTEMPLATION

01.01. Now, YOGA teachings are presented.
01.02. YOGA is control over state of mind variations.
01.03. Then the soul experiences everything as it is naturally.
01.04. Otherwise, the mind distracts the soul and influences the experience.
01.05. Five are the mind variations, each are harmful or harmless:
01.06. Correct knowledge, incorrect knowledge, imagination, sleep and memory.
01.07. Correct knowledge is sense perception, logical assumption or testimony.
01.08. Incorrect knowledge is mistaken knowledge not based on true form.
01.09. Imagination is knowledge based on words without real experience.
01.10. Sleep is a non lucid state of mind in absence of content and activity.
01.11. Memory is retention of conscious knowledge previously experienced. 
01.12. Mind variations are controlled by practice and non-attachment. 
01.13. Practice is effort to concentrate and control the mind variations.
01.14. Practice succeeds when made continuous, prolonged and with conviction.
01.15. Non-attachment is absence of cravings when consciousness is mastered. 
01.16. Strong non-attachment is indifference of nature or distractions.
01.17. Contemplation with mind support consists of four progressive stages: with
       physical awareness, with subtle awareness, with bliss, sense of I-ness.
01.18. Contemplation without support is achieved by determination in practice
       where only potential past impressions remain. Self-awareness beyond mind.
01.19. Even those without physical body or merged in nature will rebirth.
01.20. For others come with faith, vigour, memory, absorption and discernment.
01.21. With intense practice the absorption state comes sooner and faster.
01.22. However success varies with intensity of practice: mild, medium or high.
01.23. Or this state can be achieved by dedicated devotion to supreme god. 
01.24. Supreme god is a soul unaffected by obstacles, impression and desire.
01.25. Supreme god soul knows everything there is to be known.
01.26. Eternal supreme god is the master of all masters, even most ancient.
01.27. Mystical sound OM is the expressive designation of timeless supreme god.
01.28. Repeating OM while contemplating its meaning helps to relate to god. 
01.29. From this practice obstacles disappear and inner consciousness is gained.
01.30. Nine are the obstacles: disease, idleness, doubt, carelessness, laziness,
       attachment, illusion, lack of perseverance and regression.
01.31. Obstacles and distractions produce suffering, despair, body trembling and
       disturbed breathing.
01.32. Concentration practice on one single object prevents and eliminates
       obstacles and distractions.
01.33. Undisturbed mind cultivates friendliness toward those happy, compassion
       toward those unhappy, joy toward those virtuous and disregard toward
       those non virtuous.
01.34. Calm is gained by controlled extended exhalation and retention of breath.
01.35. Or by focusing on sense perceptions also causes mind steadiness.
01.36. Or by concentrating on the blissful and painless supreme light within.
01.37. Or by contemplating a great soul free from sense attachment and desire.
01.38. Or by holding attention on an experience from dreams or deep sleep.
01.39. Or by meditation on anything chosen which is enlightening and elevated. 
01.40. Gradually mastery extends from atom to the greatest infinite magnitude.
01.41. By complete absorption free from distractions, mind as a pure crystal
       assumes form of contemplated, merging knower, knowable and knowledge.
01.42. In this stage, awareness intermixes notion of word, meaning and idea.
01.43. Upon memory purification the contemplated shines without awareness.
01.44. In the same way any object of contemplation is explained.
01.45. Except when subtle nature of contemplated is undefinable.
01.46. Each of above states are meditative absorption with defined seed.
01.47. In pure contemplation the inner self is enlightened. 
01.48. In this state there is absolute true conscious wisdom.
01.49. This special experienced truth is different from correct knowledge.
01.50. The newly born impression dominates the other impressions.
01.51. When this impression is wiped out and all impressions are gone. There is
       seedless meditative absorption. Immortality is realized.

				    PRACTICE

02.01. Yoga in practice is self-discipline, study and dedication to supreme god.
02.02. Helps minimize obstacles attaining meditative absorption contemplation.
02.03. Five are the obstacles: ignorance, ego, desire, aversion and dependency.
02.04. Ignorance is the source of all, weather dormant, weak or fully active.
02.05. Ignorance regards self as non-self, eternal as temporary, pure as impure,
       and pleasant as painful.
02.06. Ego is to consider the power of seer and instrument of seeing the same.
02.07. Desire identifies with pleasurable experiences or everlasting happiness.
02.08. Aversion identifies with painful past experiences or situations.
02.09. Dependency affects even the wise, flowing by its own potency due to past.
02.10. The subtle obstacles are avoided by returning the mind to original state.
02.11. When active the obstacles can be destroyed by meditation.
02.12. These obstacles root actions and reactions in present or future lives.
02.13. Roots fructify individuals types of birth, life spans and experiences.
02.14. Reactions bear fruits of pleasure or pain as result of virtue or vice.
02.15. To one who discriminates everything is painful due to consequences of
       conflict in state of mind qualities, impressions and fear of regression.
02.16. Unmanifested pain or suffering is avoidable.
02.17. The cause of avoidable pain is the union or mix of the seer and seen.
02.18. The nature of seen is illumination, activity and inertia and consists of
       the elements and senses, whose purpose is seer experience and liberation.
02.19. Stages of qualities are specific, non-specific, defined and undefinable.
02.20. The seer is the power of seeing, although pure, sees through the mind.
02.21. The seen exists exclusively for the sake of the seer.
02.22. Although inexistent for the illuminated it still exists for the others. 
02.23. The union of seer and seen causes recognition of nature and their powers.
02.24. The cause of this union is based on ignorance.
02.25. From absence of ignorance, seer attains illumination dissolving union.
02.26. Continuous discriminative perception is the path to illumination. 
02.27. True insight and wisdom has seven final stages or aspects:
         1) End of desire to know anything more.
         2) End of aversion.
         3) End of desire to obtain anything new.
         4) End of desire to change anything.
         5) End of sorrow.
         6) End of fear.
         7) End of delusion.
02.28. Yoga practice components destroy impurities and lightens wisdom leading
       to discriminative perception. 
02.29. There are eight essential Yoga practice components:
         1) Abstinence (attitudes toward environment).
         2) Observance (attitudes toward ourselves).
         3) Posture (practice of body exercises).
         4) Breath control (practice of breathing exercises).
         5) Sense withdrawal (restraint of our senses).
         6) Concentration (ability to direct our minds).
         7) Meditation (ability to interact with object contemplated).
         8) Contemplation or absorption (complete integration with object).
02.30. Abstinences are non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, moderation and
       non-greediness
02.31. These great vows are universal and not limited by type of birth, place of
       origin, time or circumstance.
02.32. Observances are purity, contentment, accept and not cause pain, study of
       scriptures and devotion to supreme god.
02.33. When disturbed by negative thoughts, cultivate counteracting thoughts.
02.34. Thoughts such as violence are caused by greed, anger or delusion and are
       based on ignorance resulting in pain and sufferance.
02.35. Hostility ceases in the presence of one established in non-violence.
02.36. Actions and reactions are fruitful by one established in truthfulness.
02.37. All wealth comes to presence of one established in non-stealing.
02.38. Vital power or energy comes to one established in moderation. 
02.39. Origin and birth reasons manifest to one established in non-greediness.
02.40. Purity arises disgust for own body and cessation of contact with others. 
02.41. Purity of mind attains cheerfulness, one-pointedness, sense control and
       qualification for self realization.
02.42. Contentment results in supreme joy and total happiness.
02.43. Accepting and not causing pain perfects senses and body.
02.44. Study of scriptures establishes connection with chosen divine deity.
02.45. Devotion to supreme god perfects ultimate pure absorption contemplation.
02.46. Posture should be steady and comfortable presence.
02.47. Posture is mastered by relaxation and by meditating on the infinite.
02.48. Then, the dualities of the opposites are not disturbing.
02.49. After posture, breath can be regulated, controlled and mastered.
02.50. Breath movements are inhalation, exhalation and suspension, which are
       short or long regulated by place, time and number.
02.51. The fourth type of breath control transcends external and internal.
02.52. Then, it weakens and helps to destroys the cover of the illumination.
02.53. And the mind qualifies for concentration.
02.54. Senses withdrawal occurs when the senses do not come into contact with
       their respective objects and it corresponds to the nature of the mind.
02.55. Then senses are mastered with highest control.

				ACCOMPLISHMENTS

03.01. Concentration is fixing the mind in one place.
03.02. Meditation is the continuous flow of cognition toward contemplated.
03.03. Contemplation is when meditation shines contemplated without its form.
03.04. Practice of these three is called SAMYAMA, most perfect concentration.
03.05. Mastery of SAMYAMA brings true light and transcendental wisdom.
03.06. SAMYAMA is applied and accomplished in stages.
03.07. These three are more internal compared to the previous five components.
03.08. Even these three are external in relation to seedless contemplation.
03.09. Controlling impressions create new suppressive mind variations, when mind
       merges with new variations it develops suppressive state of attention.
03.10. Peaceful and undisturbed flow are based on suppressive mind variations or
       impressions and this flow becomes steady through practice and habit.
03.11. Reducing distractions by raising one point attention develops absorption.
03.12. One-pointedness is when just past and present impressions are identical.
03.13. By this, the changes in nature, quality and conditions of elements and
       senses are explained.
03.14. The substance by nature goes through past, present and future phases.
03.15. The changes in the sequence of phases causes the differences in stages of
       changes or transformations seen as evolution.
03.16. Practising SAMYAMA on the three stages of changes in evolution (nature,
       quality and conditions) brings knowledge of past and future.
03.17. Correlation between word, meaning and idea brings confusion, by SAMYAMA
       on distinction between them, knowledge of speech of all creatures arises.
03.18. By SAMYAMA on mental impressions knowledge of past birth is obtained.
03.19. By SAMYAMA on others ideas knowledge of their minds is obtained.
03.20. This knowledge does not include the motive supported in others mind.
03.21. By SAMYAMA on the body form and suspending perception by intercepting
       light from the eyes, the body becomes invisible. The same explains
       disappearance of sound, touch, taste and smell. (03.22)
03.22. Reactions manifest quickly or slowly, by SAMYAMA on them knowledge of
       time and circumstance of death is obtained.
03.23. By SAMYAMA on friendliness and such qualities, strengthen them.
03.24. By SAMYAMA on elephants strength their strength is obtained.
03.25. By SAMYAMA on the inner light, knowledge of the subtle, hidden or remote
       is obtained.
03.26. By SAMYAMA on the sun, knowledge of the solar system is obtained.
03.27. By SAMYAMA on the moon, knowledge of the stars arrangement is obtained.
03.28. By SAMYAMA on pole star, knowledge of the stars movements is obtained.
03.29. By SAMYAMA on navel plexus, knowledge of body arrangement is obtained.
03.30. By SAMYAMA on the throat pit, control of hunger and thirst is achieved.
03.31. By SAMYAMA on the tortoise tube, steady meditative posture is achieved.
03.32. By SAMYAMA on the crown light, visions of perfected souls are obtained.
03.33. Or by spontaneous intuition, knowledge of everything.
03.34. By SAMYAMA on the heart, knowledge of the mind is obtained.
03.35. All experiences are caused by no distinction between intellect and self,
       intellect exists for the sake of the self and the self for its own sake,
       by SAMYAMA on the distinction, knowledge of the self is obtained.
03.36. From this knowledge rises intuition and high sense perception as hearing,
       touch, vision, taste and smell.
03.37. These higher senses are accomplishments to a raising mind, but are still
       obstacles to the final goal of contemplation with absorption.
03.38. By loosening the cause of bind between mind and body and by knowledge of
       the mind functioning, the mind can enter into the bodies of others.
03.39. By mastery over the nerve current, vital air, one attains levitation over
       water, swamps and thorns without contact and can leave the body at will.
03.40. By mastery over the navel nerve current, vital air, radiance is attained.
03.41. By SAMYAMA on relation between ear and ether, divine hearing is attained.
03.42. By SAMYAMA on relation between body and ether, and by meditating on the
       cotton lightness, travel through ether and sky becomes possible.
03.43. By SAMYAMA on out-of-body experience which is unidentified thought waves,
       the cover of the illumination is destroyed.
03.44. By SAMYAMA on the gross and subtle elements and their essential nature,
       constitution and purpose, mastery over the elements is obtained.
03.45. From this, mystic powers manifest and body attains perfection in absence
       of limitations. The eight mystic powers are:
         1) Minuteness: ability to become very small.
         2) Largeness: ability to become very big.
         3) Lightness: ability to become very light.
         4) Heaviness: ability to become very heavy.
         5) Attainment: ability to reach anything anywhere.
         6) Freedom of will: ability to achieve all desires.
         7) Lordship: ability to create elements and anything.
         8) Mastery: ability to command and control everything.
03.46. Body perfection means beauty, charm, strength, hardness and robustness.
03.47. By SAMYAMA on the power of perception, on the essential nature, on the
       ego, on the purpose of the sense organs, comes control over the senses.
03.48. From that, body moves as fast as mind, functions independent of senses
       and complete mastery over primordial matter and cause.
03.49. By discernment distinction between intellect and self, omniscience and
       supremacy over all states and forms of existence, omnipotence, is gained.
03.50. By non-attachment even to the mystic powers, the seeds of all faults are
       destroyed and follows supreme or ultimate liberation and absolute unity.
03.51. The temptation to accept the deities invite and smile with pride tends
       toward undesirable consequences and attachment.
03.52. By SAMYAMA on the moment in sequence, discriminative knowledge is gained.
03.53. Then in-distinction becomes distinction when species, characteristics and
       locations are comparable and alike.
03.54. Discriminative knowledge simultaneously explains everything at all times
       being transcendent which brings liberation.
03.55. When the intellectual purity is exactly the same as the self, there is
       liberation and absoluteness.

				  ABSOLUTENESS

04.01. Mystic powers arise in minds due to previous births, by herbs, sacred
       incantations, accepting pain or by contemplation in absorption.
04.02. Changes in species by rebirths are due to nature flooding and overflow.
04.03. Incidental events do not cause natural evolution but removes obstacles.
04.04. Ego sense alone is the cause and influence of artificially created minds.
04.05. Although different, the created minds are directed by the original one.
04.06. Only meditative minds are free from action and reaction impressions.
04.07. Meditative minds actions and reactions are neither black nor white,
       others are black (bad), white (good) or grey (mixed).
04.08. Of these actions, only the favourable subconscious impressions manifest.
04.09. Although separated by birth, time and place, memories and impressions are
       identical because there is uninterrupted connection between them.
04.10. Impressions are eternal because desire to live is also eternal.
04.11. Because of interconnectedness of impressions by cause, motive, substance
       (the mind) and support, they are absent when these four disappear.
04.12. Past and future exist in reality and manifest due to differences from
       the present in terms of time and conditions of their characteristics.
04.13. Whether manifested or subtle, past, present and future characteristics
       are natural to the substance primal force and attributes.
04.14. Reality of things are due to uniformity of primal force changes.
04.15. Due to differences in minds, perception of same object may vary.
04.16. Object existence is not dependent upon a single mind, if it was, what
       would happen to it when the mind did not perceive it?
04.17. An object is known or unknown dependent on whether the mind noticed it.
04.18. Mind variations are always known to its master, the self, because of its
       unchanging nature.
04.19. The mind is not self-luminous because it is an object of perception.
04.20. The mind cannot perceive both subject and object at the same time.
04.21. If the mind could perceive the mind itself, there would be infinite
       perception and confusion of memory by infinite impressions.
04.22. The consciousness of the self is unchanging, by reflecting it, the mind
       becomes conscious of the self and consciousness aware of the intellect.
04.23. The mind coloured by both seer and seen, understands everything.
04.24. The mind with its countless impressions exists for the sake of the self
       because it operates in conjunction with other entities such as senses.
04.25. When one sees the distinction between the mind and self, reflection or
       meditation on the nature of the self ceases forever.
04.26. Then the mind inclines toward discernment and gravitates to liberation.
04.27. In the meantime distractions may arise due to past impressions.
04.28. Past impressions can be removed as in the case of obstacles explained.
04.29. One who has no interest in the fruits of meditative wisdom due to perfect
       discrimination, attains cloud of virtue like a rainfall of pure clarity.
04.30. This state is free from actions, reactions and the five obstacles.
04.31. When all impurities have been removed, due to the unlimited nature of
       knowledge, what remains to be known is almost nothing.
04.32. Then the three primal forces, stages of change, terminate their sequence
       because their purpose, experience and liberation, is now fulfilled.
04.33. The sequence means uninterrupted moment progression recognized at the end
       of their changes by ultimate liberation.
04.34. The ultimate liberation manifests when the primal forces return to their
       original state, having no more purpose to serve the self. In other words,
       the power of pure consciousness is situated in its own pure nature.
