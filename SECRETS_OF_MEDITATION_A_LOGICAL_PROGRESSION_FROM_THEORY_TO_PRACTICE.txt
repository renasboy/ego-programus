- 02. INTRODUCTION (Why This Guide and Contents)
  * The decision to write this short practical guide on meditation was initiated after going through a considerable amount of content and still not fully grasping it.
  * After reading multiple books, numerous online articles, and watching numerous videos, it became apparent that the contents were often very similar.
  * Following lessons and practical sessions with professional guides did not yield much evolution, as the information shared was largely the same.
  * In the end, it all boils down to this: sit down quietly without moving, empty the mind, and focus on the breath.
  * This does not sound very logical; if the mind is empty, how can it focus on anything, given that the mind is used to applying focus?
  * Only after years of continuous and prolonged daily practice did some aspects, never mentioned before, become noticeable and clear.
  * These aspects are the central content of this short practical guide and gave rise to the title: Secrets of Meditation.
  * Furthermore, the content sections are presented in a logical progression from theory to practice, hence the second part of the title.
  * Hopefully, this practical content and style become easy to follow and help enlighten the path to a meditative state of mind.

  "Universal knowledge should be spread so that everyone can find the path to unity."

- 03. WHAT MEDITATION IS NOT (Before Explaining What it is)
  * Not easy
  * Not doing nothing
  * Not sitting still without moving
  * Not emptying the mind and thinking of nothing
  * Not thinking or letting the mind wander about the past and future
  * Not reflecting or analyzing a situation and feeling emotions about it
  * Not a solution for everything

- 04. WHAT IS MEDITATION (In Short)
  * Is hard and intense
  * Is a practice to be actively exercised in sessions
  * Is control over the body and mind
  * Is uninterrupted, prolonged concentration on a chosen object
  * Is presence in the current moment, the present, here and now
  * Is a process to restrain the mind by removing distractions
  * Is a path to enlightenment and unity

- 05. THEORY (How to Practice Meditation)
  * Meditation is challenging because, during the initial stages, the mind has to be used to control itself.
  * The goal is to maintain a continuous flow of cognition on a chosen object for as long as possible.
  * By controlling the breath, the first and most common object of concentration is used, which is the breath itself.
  * Therefore, visualization and imagination play an important role during meditation practice before uninterrupted concentration is mastered.
  * Visualizing anything that can be imagined about the chosen object helps maintain focus and concentration.
  * However, distractions will inevitably occur, and upon realization of the distraction, focus should return to the chosen object.
  * This process of concentration and distractions repeats multiple times in loop cycles.
  * This loop cycle of trying to concentrate and re-concentrate on the chosen object is called meditation practice.
  * When concentration is achieved for a prolonged and uninterrupted period, it can be considered and called meditation.
  * Meditation practice is done in sessions, which are repeated possibly multiple times daily and vary according to availability.
  * Each session is different, as it depends on the current state of mind; however, with effort and determination, progress is noticed.
  * The state of mind before practice starts should be: there is nothing else at this moment, apart from myself, here, with the object of focus.
  * Once meditation is mastered, it is possible to achieve contemplation with absorption; however, this is beyond the topic of meditation.
  * During absorptive contemplation, the experience excludes the mind and merges with the chosen object, bypassing the mind.

- 06. ENERGY CENTRES (The So-Called Chakras)
  * There are hundreds of energy centres spread throughout the whole body.
  * However, the seven largest and most important ones are along the spine and head.
  * These seven energy centres are located inside the spine or head and not at skin level.
  * Their names are indicative of the height along the spine or head where they are located.
  * Each energy centre is represented by a visual light colour that helps during visualization.
  * The colours correspond in the same order as the rainbow colours, from the first (red, at the bottom) to the seventh (violet, at the top).
  * The first is the root centre, located at the very bottom of the spine, almost in contact with the floor when seated, represented by the colour red.
  * The second is the sacral centre, located at the height of the sexual organs, represented by the colour orange.
  * The third is the solar plexus centre, located at the navel height (belly button), represented by the colour yellow.
  * The fourth is the heart centre, located at the height of the heart, in the middle of the chest, represented by the colour green.
  * The fifth is the throat centre, located at the height of the throat and neck, represented by the colour blue.
  * The sixth is the third eye centre, located at the height of the forehead, represented by the colour purple.
  * The seventh is the crown centre, located at the height of the scalp, at the top of the head, almost outside the body, represented by the colour violet (or white).
  * During practice, breath is used together with visualization techniques to help the mind unclog the energy centres, one by one.

- 07. CLOTHING (How to Dress)
  * It is important to wear comfortable and suitable clothing.
  * Comfortable clothing allows for uninterrupted and prolonged practice.
  * Ideally, wear loose attire, such as pyjamas or a robe.
  * Avoid elastics or anything too tight.
  * Avoid any type of shoes; socks are fine.
  * Avoid caps or hats, ties, and belts.
  * Avoid glasses, pulse watches, bracelets, rings, earrings, or accessories in general.

- 08. LOCATION (Where to Practice)
  * Choose a quiet place with as few interruptions and distractions as possible; turn off mobile phones.
  * Initially, practice indoors; after gaining some experience, outdoor practice is also possible.
  * Select a location protected from too bright light, with a temperature that is neither too warm nor too cold; avoid cold wind currents.
  * Ideally, use the same spot whenever possible to facilitate the creation of a routine.

- 09. DURATION (How Long to Practice)
  * Reserve time to engage in proper practice when nothing else is necessary or requiring attention.
  * Session duration usually depends on the time available, as well as the state of mind and posture.
  * Start with a 5-minute session, incorporating a simple breath control exercise.
  * Extend to 15 minutes by including a body scan, focusing on different parts of the body while controlling the breath.
  * Extend to 30 minutes by adding focus on the energy centres instead of a body scan, while controlling the breath.
  * Extend to 45 minutes by choosing something enlightening and elevated to focus on after unclogging the energy centres with visualization.
  * A session duration of 60 minutes is not uncommon nowadays, although historically, sessions could last for days, weeks, or even months.
  * If anxiety arises during the practice to hurry and finalize the session for other tasks, this is not meditation.
  * The best tip is to be present, focus on the current moment, practice concentration, and forget about time; this is meditation.

- 10. TIMING (When to Practice)
  * Ideally, make it the first activity in the morning, right after waking up.
  * Begin with one session in the morning before breakfast.
  * Extend to one more session in the evening before sleep.
  * Alternatively, choose any other convenient time, always ensuring there are fewer or no distractions.
  * Later on, extend to as many sessions as desired depending on availability.
  * Ideally, practice at the same time consistently, if possible, to facilitate the creation of a routine.

- 11. POSTURE (How to Sit and Position the Body)
  * It is essential to find a comfortable posture.
  * Essentially, the posture should be comfortable, relaxed, yet steady and present.
  * A comfortable posture allows for uninterrupted and prolonged practice.
  * The most important aspect is to maintain a straight spine, including the lower back, back, neck, and head.
  * During extended inhalation, check that the spine is steady and properly straight.
  * Position the nose and chin neither too high nor too low; imagine a puppet hanging by its ears.
  * The most common posture is a seated position, although standing or lying down is not uncommon, keeping the spine straight at all times.
  * The use of a chair is also common, as long as both feet touch the ground, the spine remains straight, and there is no leaning on back support.
  * Keep the legs relaxed, ideally in the famous lotus position; however, half-lotus or simply crossed legs are also suitable, gradually progressing towards the lotus position.
  * Allow the hands to rest relaxed over the lap, with palms up above each other and thumbs slightly touching.
  * Alternatively, the hands can rest relaxed over the knees with palms up, while the middle finger slightly touches the thumb.
  * Ideally, keep the eyes slightly open; however, it is possible to begin with closed eyes to avoid distractions and open them along the session gradually.
  * Keep the eyes relaxed, avoid moving or focusing on anything, with the gaze pointing down in the nose direction.
  * Keep the mouth closed, relaxed, with the jaw and tongue resting.
  * In case of pain or discomfort, try to concentrate and relax the affected body part; if it does not help, adjust the posture.
  * Anything can be adjusted during the session, especially the legs; find balance and recentre until the optimal posture is mastered.
  * Do not feel pressured to remain still or unchanged; adjust and adapt until a steady comfort is achieved.
  * It is okay to sneeze, cough, or clear the throat if it happens.
  * Sitting on a firm, stable, and low (but not too soft) cushion or pillow can be helpful.
  * Stretching the body before and after the session can also be beneficial.

- 12. BREATHING (How to Control the Breath)
  * Breathing is done exclusively through the nostrils.
  * Utilize breath control and regulation techniques, where exhalation is longer than inhalation and includes a short suspension.
  * Control the breath at the throat, serving as a valve and producing a characteristic subtle sound.
  * The goal is to have long and slow movements that evolve with practice, extending little by little with every cycle and session.
  * During extended inhalation, straighten up the back, neck, and head until the lungs are totally full, all the way through.
  * During suspension, for just a brief moment, relax the abdomen and navel area, the belly, and loosen the legs.
  * Suspension is supposed to be brief and comfortable; the lungs should not crave air, and with practice, control is mastered.
  * Exhalation is done as extended and slow as possible, consistent and almost imperceptible.
  * During exhalation, the diaphragm muscle may get tired and sore; it helps to slightly inhale to relax the muscle and continue the exhalation process.
  * This technique to relax the diaphragm can be used repeatedly until the lungs are totally empty.
  * At the end of the extended and slow exhalation, slightly lower the torso, like bowing forward, and exhale until the lungs are totally empty.
  * If the lungs crave air and interrupt the flow, first try controlling it; if not possible, try a less extended cycle next.
  * Once mastered, a breathing cycle, including inhalation, suspension, and exhalation, can take up to 3 minutes per single cycle.
  * Those 3 minutes are divided into 40 seconds of inhalation, 20 seconds of suspension, and 120 seconds of exhalation, using the diaphragm technique.

- 13. VISUALIZATION (How to Guide the Mind into the Flow and Unclog Energy Centres)
  * Visualization is done together with breathing, using breath as a guide to unclog energy centres; everything happens in the mind.
  * Visualize the internal of the spine as an energy tube or pipe where energy can flow up and down when unclogged.
  * Visualize the energy flowing up and down the energy tube while breathing in and out, during inhalation and exhalation.
  * Visualize the seven energy centres along the spine: root, sacral, solar plexus, heart, throat, third eye, and crown, represented by colours.
  * Visualize the energy centres being unclogged by each breath cycle, one by one, from the bottom up, so that the energy can flow freely inside the body.
  * During inhalation, visualize the energy moving slowly up the tube, unclogging the energy centres along the way, one at a time.
  * During breath suspension, visualize the energy concentrating and spinning in place, inside the spine at the position of the energy centre.
  * During exhalation, visualize the energy concentrated in place, inside the spine, at the highest unclogged energy centre.
  * With every breath cycle, visualize that the breath helps to clean the energy tube and unclog the next energy centre.
  * Visualize that when the energy tube is clean, energy can flow freely from root to crown or any other energy centre.
  * Visualize that while straightening the back, neck, and head, the energy can flow easily.
  * Visualize the energy flowing via the magnetic field of the body, up through the spine from root to crown, and then down around the body from crown to root.

- 14. SENSATIONS (What the Body Senses During Practice)
  * Sensations are not the goal of meditation; therefore, do not expect or search for them, although they can occur at any moment during deep practice.
  * Sensations are closer to body feelings; they are not thoughts and emerge spontaneously and unconsciously.
  * Sense body lightness, full-body relaxation, and calming, including head lightness.
  * Sense alternation between warm and cold waves of energy through body extremities and limbs, accompanied by tingles.
  * Sense heart pounding, chest pounding, or whole-body pulsing, accompanied by waves of energy flowing through the body.
  * Sense a bright warm light coming from above, as if illumination is closer, noticeable even with eyes closed.
  * Sense the whole body slightly tingling, accompanied by variations of warm and cold waves of energy spreading.
  * Sense strong tingling through the body and head, especially the brain area, spreading through the spine, followed by slight dizziness.
  * Visualize one single fixed tiny dot of light in the middle of the visual field where energy flows around, and all visual forms derive from it.
  * If eyes are closed, they might start to slightly open by themselves, unconsciously.
  * The mouth might form a slight uncontrolled smile of gratitude, unconsciously.
  * Sense a sudden silence, as if everything became quiet all at once, and calm reigns altogether.
  * The body might adjust itself to find a more comfortable posture, re-centering, or repositioning the hands, unconsciously.
  * Feel a sense of oneness with everything and everyone; after all, everything is how it should be and where it belongs.
  * When the illumination state is closer or reached, the sun might shine through and come out for a moment, even on a rainy day.
  * Once sensations arise, do not be afraid to lose yourself and let yourself flow with the energy, surfing the energy.
  * Feel other dimensions of this universe spinning around yourself; sometimes, it also happens to visualize them in flashes.
  * Ultimately, enjoy all sensations together, combined and stronger, as if rolling out of this reality.

- 15. PRACTICE (Hands-On Step-by-Step Practice)
  * Meditation practice is personal and individual, not done in a group; it is for the self and not for others.
  * Start with a little body stretching, especially arms, legs, back, and neck; this helps endure the posture.
  * Sit down on a firm cushion and choose a comfortable crossed-legs position, relaxed and steady.
  * Optionally, light up an incense, which is recommended and helps to relax.
  * Optionally, close the eyes partially letting some light come through or fully to avoid distractions.
  * Warm up both hands by quickly rubbing them against each other and then spreading the warmth around the body.
  * Spread by rubbing hands through the face, warm up the head, arms, repeating for chest, abdomen, and legs.
  * Place hands together, palm with palm in front of the chest, at heart height; this position represents union.
  * Take a slow, deep inhalation while slowly raising both hands together until they are in front of the forehead.
  * Hold the breath for a little while, keeping hands united in front of the forehead in the meantime.
  * Exhale slowly while also slowly lowering hands, united together, returning to the initial position in front of the chest.
  * At the end of exhalation, with hands still united, slowly bow two or three times while expelling all air from lungs.
  * Repeat these steps two or three times, optionally raising united hands higher than the forehead, to the crown or all the way up.
  * Separate the hands while stretching the back, chest, and arms, then choose a comfortable arms and hands position while exhaling all air.
  * At this point, start the visualization process, with the intention to unclog the energy centres and energy flow.
  * Take a slow deep inhalation while visualizing the energy flowing to the first energy centre, root, with the colour red.
  * Suspend the breath for a while, not too much to crave for air; check body posture, straighten the back, relax and let loose the belly.
  * Release the air as slowly as possible, controlling exhalation, always without a craving for air using diaphragm technique until the lungs are empty.
  * Repeat this breath cycle two more times for the first energy centre, root, red, so three in total per energy centre.
  * Repeat this breath cycle three times for each successive energy centre, so 21 breath cycles in total for the seven energy centres.
  * After 21 breath cycles, the actual meditation practice with a focus object starts; choose a mental object of concentration.
  * Focus on the chosen object and keep breathing all the way from the first, root, red, to the seventh, crown, violet energy centre.
  * Try to stay concentrated for as long as possible on the chosen object without interruptions or distractions.
  * Whenever distraction arises, recognize it and return focus to the chosen object of concentration; this is the actual practice.
  * Constantly check on the posture and adjust or adapt if necessary; back, head, arms, or legs until a comfortable posture is mastered.
  * At the end of the practice, repeat the initial steps raising and lowering united hands together, a couple of bows during the end of exhalation.
  * The meditation practice is done; slowly move the body out of position, stretch and stand up, continue to have a great day.
  * This practice can be repeated as many times as necessary, once mastered, also with possible variations.

- 16. CONCLUSION (Please Make Sure to Take Your Own)
  * Meditation might be challenging but not impossible.
  * With dedication, meditation practice can be mastered.
  * Meditation brings long term benefits when practice becomes a routine.
