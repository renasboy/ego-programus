This one is dedicated to the invisible side of the Universe.

================================ UNIVERSE AGAIN ================================

	    It's something we've never seen and maybe will never see,
			    since we are part of it,
		  you cannot concentrate in one logical point.
	    Because everything is happening at the exact same time,
		      whatever we want to exit. (believe)
