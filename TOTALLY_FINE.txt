This one is dedicated to the Universe, constant creator and destroyer. 

================================= TOTALLY FINE =================================

		   From death we are seeing all our memories
		   and from death we can control everything.
		We are the evil of the evil, and thats no good.
		    And we are now going to make you suffer!

			...and now, on the other side...

		    We can see all our memories from above,
			 we are really happy with them,
			   they are a track of light
		and are going to shine hard into your darkness!

				    --------

			 We are everything we wanna be.

		    We are fragments of the actual reality,
		    so the real reality will never be known.

	    Everything you can imagine there is a pattern for that.
		  (and the most beautiful thing is to imagine,
		    my love for you exists in this pattern)

		     So if we all together think about it,
			       and praise for it,
			    everything will be fine.

				 Totally fine.
