This one is dedicated to all the sick people in this world, still suffering. 

================================= SICK PEOPLE ==================================

			 We, sick people, seek healing.
		       We seek the hurt of our fellings.

			Fellings that we can't control.
			Fellings that we can't give up.

			  Maybe one day I'll be able,
			to seek and get sick on my own.
