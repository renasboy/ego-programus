This one is dedicated to light observers, comtemplating light at any time. 

================================ LIGHT PASSING =================================

			 Light is passing all the time,
		   even when it's dark we can see it passing.
	This only happens because WE ARE LIGHT and EVERYTHING IS LIGHT.
